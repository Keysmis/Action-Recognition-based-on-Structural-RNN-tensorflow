# Action-Recognition-based-on-Structural-RNN-tensorflow

Thanks fro the great work of Structural-RNN from https://github.com/asheshjain399/RNNexp/tree/srnn/structural_rnn
Thanks for the tensorflow version of this network of https://github.com/Sephora-M/master-thesis
This repository does some further work of Structural-RNN in action recognition, include adding the edgeRNN and nodeRNN by adding the skeleton joints connection. the details of this work will be update soon.
